Problem:What is the lifetime of a variable? Give an example.
Solution:  The lifetime is defined in the context of a given language.
It is the period during the execution of a program during which a given variable is
    accessible by the code.
    Often (in most programming languages) the lifetime of local variables
     (variables defined/declared in a function) is while that function is executing.
